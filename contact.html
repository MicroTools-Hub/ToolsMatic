      </div>

      <h3>What Kind of Feedback We Accept</h3>
      <p><strong>Bug Reports:</strong> If a tool is not working correctly, crashes, or produces unexpected results, tell us. Include the tool name, what you were trying to do, what happened instead, and your browser type if possible. Screenshots or screen recordings help immensely.</p>
      <p><strong>Feature Requests:</strong> Think ToolsMatic should have a new tool or a new capability in an existing tool? Explain why it would be useful and who would benefit. The more context, the better we can evaluate the request.</p>
      <p><strong>Design and UX Feedback:</strong> Is the interface confusing? Are buttons hard to find? Is the layout broken on your device? Your usability feedback helps us create better experiences.</p>
      <p><strong>Performance Issues:</strong> If a tool is slow, uses too much memory, or drains your battery, let us know. We optimize for speed and efficiency.</p>
      <p><strong>Accessibility Feedback:</strong> Can you not use a tool because it is not keyboard accessible, does not work with screen readers, or has poor color contrast? This is important to us.</p>
      <p><strong>Privacy Questions:</strong> If you have concerns about data handling or privacy practices, ask. We are committed to transparency and will explain our choices.</p>
      <p><strong>General Praise:</strong> If ToolsMatic helped you, we would love to hear about it. Knowing that a tool made someone's day a little easier is what motivates us.</p>

      <h3>What We Do With Your Feedback</h3>
      <p>Every message you send is logged and reviewed. Bug reports go into our development queue. Feature requests are evaluated for fit with our mission and feasibility. We do not implement every suggestion, but we consider all of them. We may follow up with questions or ask for more details. We aim to respond to every legitimate inquiry within 48 hours.</p>

      <h3>What Not to Send</h3>
      <p>Please do not send us sensitive personal information, passwords, or confidential data. If you are reporting a security vulnerability, explain the issue conceptually without providing actual exploit code or credentials. If you need to share sensitive examples, we can discuss secure methods after initial contact.</p>

      <h3>Response Times</h3>
      <p>We are a small team, but we take feedback seriously. Expect a response within 24-48 business hours for most inquiries. During weekends or holidays, responses may take longer. Urgent issues are prioritized. If your issue does not get a response within a week, feel free to follow up.</p>

      <h3>Privacy of Your Communication</h3>
      <p>Any information you send us is kept confidential and used only to address your inquiry. We do not sell your contact information or use it for marketing purposes. We do not share your feedback with third parties without your permission (except as required by law). If you report a security issue, we keep details confidential until a fix is available.</p>

      <h3>Feature Request Prioritization</h3>
      <p>We evaluate new tool and feature requests based on several factors: How many users have requested it? How does it align with ToolsMatic's core mission of speed and privacy? How difficult is it to implement? We are unlikely to build tools that require heavy server infrastructure or compromise privacy, even if they are popular requests.</p>

      <h3>Known Limitations and Workarounds</h3>
      <p>Some tool limitations are intentional. For example, our image compressor is not lossless because some data compression requires tradeoffs. Our JSON formatter does not validate schema because that would require more infrastructure. Our base64 encoder does not support streaming because we keep everything in-browser. If you ask "why doesn't this tool do X," we can explain the design tradeoff and suggest workarounds if they exist.</p>

      <h3>Roadmap and Future Plans</h3>
      <p>While we do not publish a detailed public roadmap, we occasionally share plans in responses to users. Some ideas we are exploring: more advanced regex testing, better CSV handling, new design utilities, and performance improvements. Nothing is guaranteed, but we love sharing what excites us about ToolsMatic's future.</p>

      <h3>Thank You</h3>
      <p>Whether you use one tool occasionally or rely on ToolsMatic every day, thank you. Your attention, feedback, and trust are what make ToolsMatic  Fast, free, private, and useful. Get in touch anytimewe are listening.</p>

      <h3>Stay Connected</h3>
      <p>Bookmark ToolsMatic for quick access. Check back periodically to see new tools and improvements. Share ToolsMatic with colleagues and friends who might find it useful. And if you have ideas or feedback, send them our way at <a href="mailto:toolsmaticcorp@gmail.com">toolsmaticcorp@gmail.com</a>.</p>
